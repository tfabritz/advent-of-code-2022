# Advent of Code 2022

This repo consists of python notebooks to solve the puzzles of [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

I am late to the party, but because 2023 was quite a bit of fun, I decided to tackle (some) of 2022 as well.

To run, put the input for each puzzle into the corresponding day folder and name it `input.txt`
